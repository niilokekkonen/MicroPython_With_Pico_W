# MicroPython_With_Pico_W
Program to read an ADC signal with a Raspberry Pi Pico W. 

Current programs: 
Read_pot is a program reading potentiometers signals and blinking the LED in sync to the value.

# Hardware requirements:
* Raspberry Pi Pico W
* Breadboard / Development board connected to the pico.
* USB cable
* Grove cables
* Potentiometer

# How it's used:
* - Load Read_Pot.py.
* - make sure you have downloaded Thonny. If not you can get it from Thonny.org
* - Connect the circuit to ADC-1, if you connect it to another ADC-pin just change the pin number in the ADC function.
* - Make sure you have connected the Pico W to Thonny and have the right intrepeter
* - Then just hit run and it should be reading the signal coming your potentiometer

# What it's for:
With this program you can play with the basic functionality of microcontrollers. You can use the potentiometer in real life projects if needed, for example a sound volume level adjuster. You can also use this to simulate sensors measuring data and then analyzing that data into something understandable

# Feedback is welcome!
